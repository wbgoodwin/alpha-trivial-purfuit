# alpha-trivial-purfuit

## Getting Started
- If you do not already have it, go to https://nodejs.org/en/ and downlaod the LTS version of node. This install already includes npm as well.
- Clone this repo to your machine
- Open up a terminal and navigate to the /server directory for this project.
- Run `npm install` 
- Once the install is finished run `npm start`
- Run `npm install` and `npm start` in a separate terminal for the /client directory as well.

If you are running Mac OS and get an error during npm install that says something like `gyp: No Xcode or CLT version detected!` then checkout these
links to resvolve the issue https://medium.com/flawless-app-stories/gyp-no-xcode-or-clt-version-detected-macos-catalina-anansewaa-38b536389e8d or

-The app should be running on http://localhost:3000 in your browser.
-Use any text editor/IDE for editing the code. I use [VScode](https://code.visualstudio.com) and like it
